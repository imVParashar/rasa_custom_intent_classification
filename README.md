# Example of implementing custom classification for Rasa 3.X

This repository is an example of a simple Rasa project that shows how you can implement your own classifiers specially in Rasa version 3+.
The data was automatically generated by running:
```
rasa init
```

## Hugging Face Transformers Classifier
`distilbert_intent_classification.py` contains the code to finetune a `distilbert-base-uncased` model with Rasa data and use this model during the Rasa inference. The implementation of the custom intent classification model has been done using Rasa's `GraphComponent`.

## config.yml

`config.yml` contains examples of how you can insert the distilbert classifier into the Rasa pipeline.

# Running the project

To train the custom rasa intent classification model:
```rasa train```

To test the model:
```rasa test --nlu <path_to_test_data>```

To interact with the model:
```rasa shell```
